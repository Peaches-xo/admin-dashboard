### **Goals** 
Use CSS Grid to create an admin dashboard. 

    - Set up HTML & CSS files, & git repo
    - Incorporate Google font/s
    - Incorporate Material Design Icons
    - Publish on Github pages

Personal challenge: Create initial set up files & repo completely via the command line.

### **Positives**
The cards came together quicker than I had anticipated and was able to get them to line up. 

### **Challenges:**
Found it very tricky using grid for the header row layouts due to the extra space added.
After creating the rows with grid, I did end up using flex for the individual row layouts.
I felt like grid wasn't giving me the control and flexibility I was looking for, but I can see
the benefits of it for areas such as the card section. 


### **To Look Into:**
 - Make the project responsive 
 - Make cards shrink and grow when window is resized
